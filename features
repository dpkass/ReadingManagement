Next-up: Reading-Status (not started/started/reading/paused) and Writing-Status (comming-up/rolling/paused/ended)

Safe
1. Readable (UpToDate or missing Chapters (how many))
2. Categorization lists
3. Pause (until enough has come out)
4. Check if other book has abbreviation
5. Paused-until...
6. Recommendation (based on pause and not yet started)

Uncertain
1. List mod (multiple options)
2. Open mod (specialized on chrome, own class, springboot linked properties)
