Safe
1. Pause to be indefinite, but wait to have date (New Ops pause and wait)
2. rs to reading when read op used
3. grouped requestresult to display status displayvalue not statusname (better in backend)
4. OR Filters
5. Sort List-All

Uncertain
1. Change to SQL-based database

Don't know how:
1. Activate errors
