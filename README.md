# ReadingManagement

Simple website, to manage read books. You can save all sorts of Information about your books to be able to easily list and filter by them. 

This is mainly a dummy project, where I learned software development. Especially working with the Spring Boot framework including thymeleaf, Spring Data etc., but also design patterns e.g. Onion-Architecture, SOLID and FIRST.

This is the final version in this iteration. A completely new and improved version is planned for 2024, since I ended up using this tool very often.
